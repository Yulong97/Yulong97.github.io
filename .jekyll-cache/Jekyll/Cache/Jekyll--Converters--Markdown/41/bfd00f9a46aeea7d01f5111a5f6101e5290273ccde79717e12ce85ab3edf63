I"˜<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  My name is Yulong Liu (<b>åˆ˜å®‡é¾™</b>), I am interested in the connection of the virtual world and physical reality. The complexity of nature always inspired me to delve deeper and uncover its mysteries. Currently, I am a Ph.D student supervised by <a href="http://ap.polyu.edu.hk/ychai/">Prof. Yang CHAI</a> at PolyU (HK) and <a href="https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/yet/en/">Prof. Terry Tao YE</a> at SUSTech (China). My current research topics include e-textile devices, battery-less sensing and in-sensor computing.
